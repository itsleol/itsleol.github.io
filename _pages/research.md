## Undergraduate Research Program  
**Project:** *Public Trust and Attitudes toward Generative AI in China*  
**Advisor:** Dr. Pu Yan · *May 2024 – Oct 2025*  
Lead a multi-stage, mixed-methods study addressing the gap in localized AI trust measurement.  
- Developed and validated a **multi-dimensional GenAI Trust Scale** through two large-scale surveys (N=662).  
- Designed and executed a **field experiment using Tobii eye-tracking** to examine the causal effects of AI disclosure strategies on user trust.  
- Conducted statistical analysis in **R**, identifying that **simple AI labels enhance trust in conversational contexts but reduce it in news consumption**.  
- Extended this project in a **cross-cultural study** on Taiwanese public attitudes at *National Tsing Hua University* (Summer 2025, advised by Prof. Tzu-Hua Wang).  
- This project forms the empirical foundation for future work on **AI literacy and trust calibration across cultural contexts**.

- Spearheaded a mixed-methods project integrating **ethnographic fieldwork** in rural Hebei with **computational social science methods**.  
- Conducted **20+ semi-structured interviews** and **participant observation**, exploring digital life among rural women.  
- Independently scraped and analyzed comment data from **Douyin** and **Kuaishou** using **Python (BERTopic)** to model user interaction and self-presentation.  
- Authored the final report framing short-video use as a **flexible resistance to social marginalization** and a **tool for community building**.

## Empirical Research Project  
**Project:** *Alienation in Parent–Child Relationships Among Youth in the Context of Social Acceleration*  
**Advisor:** Dr. Xingkun Liang · *Feb 2025 – June 2025*  
- Designed and conducted an empirical analysis using **China Family Panel Studies (CFPS)** data to investigate kin-estrangement.  
- Applied **OLS regression**, **mediation**, and **moderation models** in **Stata** to examine how digital behaviors reshape family intimacy.  
- Found that **increased screen time significantly correlates with reduced parent–child closeness**, offering insights into intergenerational alienation under digital acceleration.
